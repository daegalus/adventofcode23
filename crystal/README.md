# Advent of Code 2022 in Crystal

For Day19, if you have a slighlty weaker computer, or a fanless, I encourage you to build the binary with `shards build --release --no-debug` and run the binary, so that it completes quickly. Day19 Part2 doesn't finish on my Surface Pro 7 i5 with no fan.

Surface Pro 7 with i5, fanless, 8gb ram
`shards build --release --no-debug`
Total runtime of all 25 days: 22.76s
Total runatime without day 19: 6.94s
